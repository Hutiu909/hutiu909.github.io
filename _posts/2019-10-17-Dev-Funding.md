UPDATE:  The proposal was resubmitted due to non-payment. 


Hello AXErunners, there are currently 2 proposals that will be funded for the upcoming superblock. The total amount for the 2 proposals 
will be 6250 AXE.  This will leave 1464 AXE available.  I am asking for your votes, as I would like to have the remaining AXE voted to the DEV Fund.
