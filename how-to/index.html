<b>Proposal Name:</b> You must enter a short, clear and unique name for the proposal, only in English (and you must use the dash "-" in the English half-width instead of a space, otherwise it will report an error) because it will appear in the blockchain. on. The name of the proposal cannot exceed 40 characters.

<b>Payment Date:</b> You will need to choose when you want the payment cycle to start.

<b>Payments:</b> You will need to choose how many payment cycles ie. single lump sum payment or payments spread out through multiple cycles. 
*For example*, if your project will start in early November and last for 5 months, and the estimated monthly cost is 100 AXE, then you need to select the start date of 2019/10/27 in Payment Date, and choose "5 Payments" cycle in Payments,and input 500 in Payment Amount.

Once you've entered the information and made sure it's correct, you can create a proposal by clicking the blue Create Proposal button in the lower right corner.
